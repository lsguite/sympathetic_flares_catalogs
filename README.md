# Sympathetic Flares Database

## Description:
This is a catalog of candidate sympathetic flares identified based on observations from three different instruments, i.e. SDO/AIA, RHESSI and Solar Orbiter/STIX. For each instrument, each row in the table represents a pair of sympathetic flares candidates. The table lists the flares ID, the start, peak and end times and the coordinates (longitude and latitude in heliographic Stonyhurst and Carrington). Additional information specific to each instrument is listed below.

## SDO/AIA
The flare data used to construct this catalog come from [van der Sande et al. (2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2022.1031211/full). The start, peak and end times correspond to the flaring interval in the 131 Å SDO/AIA channel. The table also provides flare magnitudes in the 131 Å filter, expressed in Data Number per second (raw detector output, not calibrated to irradiance units). The flare ID refers to the row number in the original list from [van der Sande et al. (2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2022.1031211/full).

## RHESSI
The flare data used to construct this catalog come from the official RHESSI flare list, available at https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessidata/dbase/hessi_flare_list.txt. The table also provides the total corrected counts of the flares, the RHESSI energy channel corresponding to the highest energy at which the flare remains detectable and the nearest active region number. 

## Solar Orbiter/STIX
The flare data used to construct this catalog come from a flarelist that builds upon the operational STIX flare list,  available at https://github.com/hayesla/stix_flarelist_science. The table also provides the GOES class of the flare, the heliographic Stonyhurst longitude and latitude, and the distance of Solar Orbiter from the Sun (in Astronomical Units) at the time of the second flare of the sympathetic pair.
